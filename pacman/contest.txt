My contest agent is simple, he looks at a depth of 5in an expectimax using the better eval function.
Basically, he likes eating power pellets and then eating ghosts if they havent been eaten yet and they are scared.
He will attempt to repeat this process (while snagging some food on the way and avoiding live not scared ghosts) as often as possible before he dies. (gets a high score but doesnt leave victorious.
